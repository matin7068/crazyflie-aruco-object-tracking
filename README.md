# crazyflie-aruco-object-tracking
This project enables a Crazyflie drone with an ArUco marker to autonomously navigate toward a fixed yellow reference marker. Using computer vision and ZeroMQ, the system tracks both markers and adjusts the drone's position until alignment is achieved. The drone lands automatically upon reaching the target.
